# The AI Handbook
This AI Handbook is meant to onboard technical and non-technical AI stakeholders to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).  Given that there is plenty of incredible content that already exists, this Handbook refers the reader to a curated list of what we've found to be particularly good resources for:

(1) Introducing the opportunities and challenges presented by AI and ML.

(2) Providing an intuitive understanding of the various AI and ML techniques, and when to apply them.

If you discover new resources or ones we've left out, please let us know!

This Handbook is written with R and RStudio — specifially [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) — and hosted by GitHub.  Thanks to [Julia Stewart Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io) for sharing best practices with her [Openscapes Champions Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/overview.html)!
